    <h1>The Hue Programming Language Specification</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome, here you will find my magnum opus.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is
      <i>the one</i>
      project I have written over and over, discarding each attempt out of disgust or plain boredom.
    </p>
    <p>
      It isn't that what I am trying to build is particularly hard to concieve of or takes so long that I haven't yet finished it, but because I have been so aimless about it that things did not go anywhere interesting or worthy a dime.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time, I plan to take a different approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us not code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us design.

      Syntax is described using EBNF (Extended Backus-Naur Form). The whole grammar can be found below with the
      <code>start</code>
      production being where parsing starts.

    <code>
      <pre>
start = top-level+

; Top level declarations
top-level = bind

bind      = ident {bind-arg} "=" expr ";"
bind-arg  = "(" ident ":" type ")"
          | ident

; Expressions
expr = match | math

match        = "match" expr "with" {match-branch}
match-branch = expr "->" expr [";"]

math = math ("+"|"-") atom
     | atom

; Atoms
atom  = apply
      | ident
      | number
      | "(" expr ")"

apply = apply atom
      | ident atom

ident = /[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]+/

number = /[0-9]+/
      </pre>
