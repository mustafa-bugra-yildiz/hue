    <h1>The Hue Programming Language Specification</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome, here you will find my magnum opus.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is
      <i>the one project</i>
      I have written over and over, discarding each attempt out of disgust or plain boredom.
    </p>
    <p>
      It isn't that what I am trying to build is particularly hard to concieve of or takes so long that I haven't yet finished it, but because I have been so aimless about it that things did not go anywhere interesting or worthy a dime.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time, I plan to take a different approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us
      <i>not code</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us
      <b>design</b>.

      <h2>Grammar</h2>
      <p>
        Syntax is described using EBNF (Extended Backus-Naur Form). The whole grammar can be found below with the
        <code>start</code>
        production being where parsing starts.
      </p>
      <code>
        <pre>
start = top-level+

; Top level declarations
top-level = bind

bind      = ident "=" expr ";"

; Expressions
expr = closure | let | match | math

closure = "#(" ident [type] ")" expr ";"

let = "let" ident "=" expr ";" expr

match        = "match" expr "with" {match-branch}

      <h2>Tokenization</h2>
      Although tokens are defined in
      <a href="#grammar">Grammar</a>,
      indentation was intentionaly left blank because it is signification in tokenization.
      There are 2 rules:
      <ul>
        <li>';' is inserted upon newlines unless the next line is indented higher than current line</li>
        <li>Multiple adjacent dedents produce single ';'</li>
      </ul>
