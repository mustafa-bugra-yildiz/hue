# The Hue Programming Language Monorepo

Welcome, here you will find my magnum opus.

This is _the one_ project I have written over and over, discarding each attempt out of disgust or plain boredom.

It isn't that what I am trying to build is particularly hard to concieve of or takes so long that I haven't yet finished it, but because I have been so aimless about it that things did not go anywhere interesting or worthy a dime.

This time, I plan to take a different approach.

Let us not code.

Let us design.
